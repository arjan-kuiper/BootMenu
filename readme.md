# Assembly BootMenu
This repository contains the .asm code for a small project I've been doing on next to my assembly school assignments. 
It's an expansion of a simple menu we had to make.

**Note:** There is probably a lot of duplicate code.

# How to use
In order to use this code you will have to compile it into a .bin file and run it in an emulator (Please use an emulator).
I am compiling my assembly code using [NASM](http://www.nasm.us/) and running it with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
